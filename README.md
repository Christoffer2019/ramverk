Note for Framework and Design Patterns Course Part 2
----------------------------------------------------

* The API [ipstack](https://ipstack.com/plan) is used for getting information about IP addresses. To test that the API works, you need to get an API key and save in config/.env.

* The api key is stored as an environment variable in config/.env. This file is not available in the repository for safety reasons, but you can find a sample file, config/.env.example where you can change the value for the environment variable.

* The package PHP dotenv is used for handling environment variables. You can find the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv#why-env).
